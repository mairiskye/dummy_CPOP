## Introduction

This repository demonstrates proposed improvements to the data pipeline for the CPOP dashboard. It obtains Local Authority level data for nine indicators from APIs and feeds these into a mock-up of the 'CPP Over Time' tab of the original dashboard. 

## Dashboard Structure

The dashboard itself is created from three standard shiny scripts `global.R` `server.R` and `ui.R`. Dashboard data is read into the `global.R` from the _/cpop_data_ folder.

The _/data_update/API_queries_ folder contains three sub folders ( _/run_first_, _/run_second_ and _/run_third_ ) each with a series of scripts which query data from five APIs for nine indicator (and two indicator denominator) datasets at Local Authority level.

The run order dictated by the file names is important: some scripts depend on denominator data in the form of a csv output generated in another script.

## Data update steps 

### 1. Version Control
Once you have cloned the repository, in the console run `renv::restore()` to synchronize your package library with that in the lockfile to ensure package dependencies for this project are met. Note: if you are asked to run `renv::activate()`, do so.

### 2. Obtain .json files from StatXplore
The StatXplore API queries use `.json` files which can be auto-generated using the StatXplore table-generator UI. These query specific time-series dates so have to be manually updated as new data becomes available (once annually). Detailed instruction for how to obtain the exact dataset are written [below](#obtain-json-files).

### 3. Update file references
Within _/data_update/API_scripts/run_second/_ you will find two scripts ( _child_poverty.R_ and _out_of_work_benefits.R_) which need to be updated with most recent .json file name. Search for the term `UPDATE ME` which signposts the line which needs updating. For example:

`#UPDATE ME`
`results <- statxplorer::fetch_table(filename = "data_update/json/child_poverty_07_21.json")`

should become...

`#UPDATE ME`
`results <- statxplorer::fetch_table(filename = "data_update/json/child_poverty_08_22.json")`

### 4. Run API scripts
Run the  `/data_update/update_data.R` file.
This runs all individual API query scripts (within _/data_update/API_queries_) in the correct order. Since this involves 10 successive API calls it might take a minute or two to complete.

### 4. Find Masterdata
Navigate to the _/cpop_data_` folder where there will be multiple files named _masterdata_dd_mm_yy.csv_. Ensure there is one with the current date - this is the output from the last step. 

### 5. Update global.R script
In the `global.R` file, find these first lines:

`#UPDATE ME - update file name manually for data update.`
`CPPdta <- readr::read_csv("cpop_data/masterdata_04_08_22.csv")`

Update the file name date so that it corresponds to the newly updated masterdata data file.

The dashboard should show the latest data when run.

## Obtain JSON Files

#### Out of Work Benefits .json File
1. Visit [Stat-Xplore](https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml) and log-in/sign up.
2. Go to  _Datasets > Benefit Combinations > Benefit Combinations - Data from February 2019_, and click the blue _'New Table'_ button above.
3. Go to  _Geography > National_Regional_LA_OAs > Great Britain_. Click on the small arrow to the RIGHT of _Scotland_ and select _Local Authority_. This should select all Scottish LAs. Click the _Row_ button above to add to table.
4. Click on _Quarter_ and select checkboxes for all _May_ quarters available. Click the _Column_ button above to add to table.
5. Under _Benefit Groups_ click on _Benefit Combinations (Out of Work)_. Click the button to the RIGHT of this and select again _Benefit Combinations (Out of Work)_. This will check all benefit categories. **IT IS IMPORTANT TO DESELECT/UNCHECK THE BOX NEXT TO _not on out of work benefits_**. Then click the _Column_ button from the top again to add to table. Should you be warned about entering large table mode, select okay.
6. In the top right corner there is a select drop down menu, select _Open Data API Query (.json)_ then press go. This will download a json file.
7. save this file to _/data_update/json/_ with the name _oowb_mm_yy.json_ (with the relevant month_year). Moving older json to historic_json after.
(The above steps can be repeated to obtain oowb_historic data by clicking on 'Benefit Combinations - Data to November 2018' at step 2 - whilst this dataset will not include more years, there may be historic updates to the data so it would be worth updating the json file).

#### Child Poverty .json File
1. Visit [Stat-Xplore](https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml) and log-in/sign up.
2. Go to _Datasets > Children in Low Income Families > Relative Low Income_ and click the blue _New Table_ button above.
3. Go to _Geography > National_Regional_LA_OAs > Great Britain_. Click on the small arrow to the RIGHT of _Scotland_ and select _Local Authority_. This should select all Scottish LAs. Click the _Row_ button above to add to table.
4. Click on _Year_ and then the little arrow to the RIGHT and select _Year_ again which checks all available years. Click on the _Column_ button in the panel above to add to table.
5. Under _Age of child (years and bands)_, check the 0-4, 5-10, and 11-15 boxes. Click on the _Column_ button in the panel above to add to table.
6. In the top right corner there is a select drop down menu, select _Open Data API Query (.json)_ then press go. This will download a json file.
7. Save this file to _/data_update/json_ with the name _child_poverty_mm_yy.json_ (with the relevant month_year of download). Moving older json to historic_json after.

### A note on other folders (helpers)

#### make_nomis_uris
The **data_update/make_nomis_uris** folder contains scripts which programatically extract parameter IDs from NOMIS dataset metadata which must be appended to the query URI (without which the response from the API is too large and is rate-limited at 25,000 observations). These script use the `nomir` package which can be found on [git hub](https://github.com/ropensci/nomisr). Any script which queries NOMIS has a corresponding make_nomis_uri script, but this is available solely to troubleshoot any problems should the API request return an error, and the data update process is not dependant on these.

#### look_ups
Some APIs return an S-Code for geography and some return council names. In order to ultimately match these, a geography code look-up csv is read in and joined to datasets which lack geography names. 

#### API_keys
The Stat-Xplore API requires authentication in the form of an API Key which is saved in this folder as a .txt file.

#### sparql queries
The [opendatascot](https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/opendatascot) package was used to search metadata for the correct dimensions to filter a given dataset by. These were then passed with the dataset ID to the function `opendatascot::ods_print_query()` which generates specific SPARQL queries. These not return exact result required but provided a good head start before editing the query in the statistics.gov.scot [SPARQL editor](https://statistics.gov.scot/sparql-beta). Then the query could be made with a http POST request, meaning there is no dependency on this package in the scripts.
